				<h3>Buglary Basics</h3>
				<p>The MOST important thing YOU can do is CALL THE POLICE to report a CRIME or any SUSPICIOUS activity. You have to be the eyes of your neighborhood. And remember you can always remain a pair of anonymous eyes!</p>
				<p>Light up your residence, lock your doors at all times, and call the Police when you see something suspicious.</p>
				<p>For additional crime prevention tips to conduct a neighborhood association or group meeting, please feel free to contact <strong>Guwahati City Police</strong> for any assistance</p>
			</div>	
			<br>
			<div class="col-md-12">	
				<h3>TIPS:</h3>
				<ul>
				  <li>Make your home look occupied, and make it difficult to break in </li>
				  <li>Lock all outside doors and windows before you leave the house or go to bed. Even if it is for a short time, lock your doors.   </li>
				  <li>Leave lights on when you go out. </li>
				  <li>Keep your garage door closed and locked</li>
				  <li>Don't allow daily supply of mail, newspapers or flyers build up while you are away. Such piles of undelivered newspapers, mail etc gives an indication to the burglars that the owner is away. Arrange with the Post Office to hold your mail, or arrange for a friend or neighbor to take them regularly. </li>
				  <li>Check your locks on doors and windows and replace them with secure devices as necessary</li>
				  <li>Pushbutton locks on doorknobs are easy for burglars to open. Install deadbolt locks on all your outside doors. </li>
				  <li>Sliding glass doors are vulnerable. Special locks are available for better security</li>
				  <li>Other windows may need better locks. Check with a locksmith or hardware store for alternatives</li>
				  <li>Be very cautions while engaging domestic help, security guards, drivers etc. Keep their full particulars including photographs and check references, but their antecedents verified with the help of Police. </li>
				  <li>Always lock your garden sheds and garages</li>
				  <li>Don't invite a thief by careless display of wealth</li>
				  <li>Use Good Quality locks</li>
				  <li>Change locks immediately if your keys are lost or stolen</li>
				  <li>Have adequate exterior lighting</li>
				  <li>Make sure your door hinges are on the inside.</li>
				  <li>You may also use concealed CC cameras and burglar alarms</li><br>
				  <h3>If Your Home Is Broken Into</h3>
				  <p>If you come home to find an unexplained open/broken window or door or a theft has taken place</p>
				  <li>Do not enter the house - the perpetrator may still be inside</li>
				  <li>Use a neighbor's phone or mobile  to call police</li>
				  <li>Do not touch anything or clean up until the police have inspected the scene of crime for evidence</li>
				  <li>Write down the license plate numbers of any suspicious vehicles</li>
				  <li>Note the descriptions of any suspicious persons. </li>
				  <li>Help the Police with collection of evidence and information.</li><br>
				  
				  <h3>Other precautions you should take:</h3>
				  <li>Never leave keys under doormats, flowerpots, mailboxes or other "secret" hiding places -- burglars know where to look for hidden keys</li>
				  <li>Keep a detailed inventory of your valuable possessions, including a description of the items, date of purchase and original value, and serial numbers, and keep a copy in a safe place away from home - vthis is a good precaution in case of fires or other disasters. Make a photographic or video record of valuable objects, heirlooms and antiques. Your insurance company can provide assistance in making and keeping your inventory</li>
				  <li>Be a good neighbour. If you notice anything suspicious in your neighborhood, call 100 immediately</li>
				  <li>Form a Neighborhood Watch Group. We can help you work with your neighbors to improve security and reduce risk of burglary</li>
				  <li>Consider installing a burglar alarm system</li>
				  
				  <h3>CAR THEFT:</h3>
				  <LI>Do not leave valuables in plain view:(GPS devices, laptops, mobiles, wallets, purses etc) </LI>
				  <li>Do not leave windows or sunroof open</li>
				  <li>Do not leave doors unlocked</li>
				  <li>Do not leave keys in the vehicle</li>
				  <li>Do not leave the garage door opener in plain view</li>
				  <li>Do not leave out items with personal information</li>
				  <li>Do not move valuable items to the trunk while in public view</li>
				  <li>Slow Down and use common sense before you leave your car</li>
				  <li>Be careful while engaging drivers. Check antecedents and keep their full particulars</li>
				  <li>It is advisable to install a GPS device in your car without the knowledge of your driver</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>DRUG & SUBSTANCE ABUSE</h3>
				<p>Inhalant abuse can kill. And if it doesnt kill you, it can leave you with severe brain damage or severe respiratory problems. Even a first time user can end up dead after "sniffing or huffing" inhalants</p>
				<p>Everyday products like glue, paint, lighter fluid, fingernail polish, permanent markers, deodorants, and anything in an aerosol can are sniffed to get a rapid and dangerous high. While this type of substance abuse may seem harmless because the products are not legally classified as drugs, they are deadly chemicals and poisons. An inhalant <code>high</code> may give the feeling of well-being and reduce inhibitions, much like the effects of alcohol and other sedatives. Higher doses produce laughter and giddiness, feelings of floating, time and space distortion, and hallucinations. But the reality is inhalant abuse has serious short- and long-term side effects</p>
			
				<h3>The Short Term</h3>
				<p>Sniffing can make you sick. For example, victims may become nauseated, forgetful, and unable to see things clearly. Some victims lose control of their bodies, including use of the arms and legs. You don't look real cool stumbling around high from inhalants. Side effects can last 15 to 45 minutes after sniffing. People who sniff often act intoxicated and experience short-term memory loss as well</p>
				
				<h3>The Long Term</h3>
				<ul>
				  <li>Potential ?sudden sniffing death,? even for first- time users </li>
				  <li>Permanent brain damage</li>
				  <li>Hearing loss</li>
				  <li>Increased heart rate</li>
				  <li>Arm or leg spasms</li>
				  <li>Bone marrow damage</li>
				  <li>Liver and kidney damage</li>
				  <li>Damage to an unborn baby, if pregnant</li>
				  <li>Chronic inhalant abusers may exhibits symptoms such as anxiety, excitability, irritability, or restlessness that can lead to violent behavior</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>What Are Some Signs of Inhalant Abuse?</h3>
				<ul>
				  <li>Unusual breath odor or chemical odor on clothing </li>
				  <li>Slurred or slowed speech </li>
				  <li>A general drunken appearance</li>
				  <li>Paint or other products on the face or fingers</li>
				  <li>Red or runny eyes or nose</li>
				  <li>Spots or sores around the mouth</li>
				  <li>Nausea and/or loss of appetite</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>What Can You Do To Prevent Inhalant Abuse</h3>
				<p>Know the facts.  Remember that inhalants are not made for the body. They are deadly chemicals and poisons. Know the many ways inhalants can damage your mind and body. Tell your friends about the dangers of inhalant abuse. And refuse to hang out with friends who sniff.</p>
				<p>As with many prevention efforts, preventing inhalant abuse takes a community effort. Organize with other teens to involve the media, retailers, schools, churches, health care providers, civic and volunteer organizations, elected officials, and the law enforcement community to stop kids from sniffing. Retailers can monitor sales of certain products. Health care providers can pass out literature to patients</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Educate your school about the dangers of inhalants through posters, newspaper articles, and announcements over the public address system at your school </li>
				  <li>Educate adults about inhalant abuse. Many parents, coaches, and teachers may not know how widespread the problem is, the extent of the danger, or how to recognize abuse </li>
				  <li>If you?re tempted to use, get help from a counselor-without any delay</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>SAFE ELECTRONIC TRANSACTION</h3>
			<br>
			<p>The most common way thieves go about getting this information is by stealing your wallet. However, other ways include looking over your shoulder at ATMs and phone booths to capture your PIN number; stealing mail from your mailbox; digging though your discarded trash; and fraudulently ordering a copy of your credit record. And before you think, ?I don?t have a credit record,? think again. As soon as you open a bank account, get a credit card or a loan, or start a store account, you?ve got a credit record</p>
			<h5><strong>To prevent this from happening to you</strong></h5>
			<ul>
			  <li>Don't give out your social security number. If your state allows it, use a number other than your social security number on your driver?s license </li>
			  <li>Tear into small pieces all credit card offers, ATM receipts, bank statements, credit card statements, and other printed materials that have your account numbers on them. Use apaper shredder if possible</li>
			  <li>Don't send personal information over the Internet, through e-mail, or over cellular phones</li>
			  <li>Dont use passwords that are obvious? names (yours or those of your friends, relatives, or pets), birth date, even street addresses. The best passwords mix numbers with upper and lowercase letters. A password that is not found in the dictionary is even better because there are programs that will try every word in the dictionary in an effort to crack your code</li>
			  <li>Avoid break-ins by changing your password regularly and memorizing it. If you have several, set up a system for remembering them. Don?t write your password on your notebook or stick it on a Post-it? note in your locker</li>
			</ul>
			
			<strong>Pay Particular Attention When Using ATM Cards and Credit Cards</strong>
			<p>One of many conveniences of a checking account is the debit or automated teller machine (ATM) card. This card allows you to get money from your account through a machine 24 hours a day. A money machine is useful, but there are a few precautions you should take</p>
			
			<strong>Protecting Your Personal Identification Number (PIN)</strong>
			<p>Just like passwords on the computers, a PIN is a confidential code issued to you that lets you have access to your account. Memorize your PIN, and don?t give it to anyone, not even family members or bank employees. The fewer people who have access to your PIN, the better. Never write your PIN on your ATM card or write it on a piece of paper and place it in your wallet. If your wallet and card are lost or stolen, someone will have everything they need to take all the money from your account</p>
		
			<strong>Using the ATM Safely</strong>
			<p>An ATM card should be treated like cash. When using the ATM machine, select one that?s code-door or double-door secured and visible to street traffic. Use when others are around. Also</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Be aware of others waiting behind you </li>
			  <li>Position yourself in front of the keyboard to prevent anyone from seeing your PIN No. as you type on the Keyboard / Keypad </li>
			  <li>Be courteous while waiting by keeping a polite distance from the person ahead of you. Allow the person to finish his or her business before approaching the machine </li>
			  <li>Remove the cash as soon as the machine releases it. Put the money in your pocket and wait until you are in a secure location before counting it. Never leave the receipt at the site</li>
			 
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Protecting Your Credit Cards </h3>
			<p>Having a credit card is a big responsibility. If you don't have your own card, a parent may lend you one for certain purchases. Whether the card is yours or your parents', here are a few tips to keep it safe</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Give your credit card account number out to make a purchase or reservation only when you have initiated the call. Never give this information over a cellular phone</li>
			  <li>Never give your credit card for someone to use on your behalf</li>
			  <li>Watch your card when giving it to sales man/ woman to protect against extra imprints being made</li>
			  <li>Destroy any carbon papers from receipts. Tear them up ? don't toss them into the trash at the purchase counter</li>
			  <li>Save all receipts and compare them to your monthly statement. Report any differences immediately</li>
			  <li>Keep a master list of all your card numbers in a secure place, preferably with your parents or another trusted adult, with all account numbers and phone numbers for reporting stolen or lost cards.</li>
			  <li>Immediately report lost or stolen cards to the issuing company and to the police</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			
			<p><strong>Never repeat NEVER give you PIN No. of your Credit /Debit Card with anyone even to anyone or any executive of the bank issuing the Credit / Debit Card</strong></p>
			<p><strong>While making purchasers etc. through the Internet, please ensure that the website is security certified</strong></p>
