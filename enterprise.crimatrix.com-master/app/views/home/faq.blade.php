        		<h4>Frequently Asked Questions regarding Subscription fees</h4>
            <p>In last three months, team Crimatrix has responded to hundreds of support calls and emails regarding the newly introduced subscription fees, from hotel managers and owners of Guwahati. Here we share the most frequently asked questions and our answers.</p>

						        <h4 class="SourceSansPro">1. Isn’t Crimatrix a government project?</h4>
					          <p>No. Crimatrix is a cloud-based platform conceptualized, developed and maintained by <a href="https://glomindz.com" target="_blank">Glomindz Software Pvt. Ltd.</a> Our mission is to build <em>"a community driven real-time crime monitoring platform" for police and public to collaborate and prevent crime in smart cities of future.</em> The project was initiated by us in Sept 2012, under the guidance of then DGP(Assam) J.N. Choudhury, SSP(Guwahati) Anand Prakash Tiwari and SSP(Crime) Amitava Sinha along with Guwahati Crime Branch.</p>

                    <h4 class="SourceSansPro">2 .We have been using Crimatrix for free for 3yrs+. Why pay now?</h4>
                    <p>We started Crimatrix as a pilot project in Oct 2012 to validate our idea, with just 20 hotels. The pilot project was partly funded by Glomindz Software Pvt. Ltd. and partly by the police department. The six months pilot project was successful and was publicly launched on 15 August 2014 by then DGP(Assam) Khagen Sharma.</p><p>Today, we have more than 300 hotels/lodges/guest houses across Guwahati on our platform. 80% of the hotels use our platform daily. Remaining 20%, at least once per week. Our servers process more than 2000 guest records on a daily basis.</p><p>To keep up with the data volume, we had to upgrade our servers for more storage and faster processing power. Our operational cost has increased by 10 times since we started. It has become difficult for us to keep the project alive. So, we decided to share a part of the cost with the hotels.</p>

                    <h4 class="SourceSansPro">3. Isn’t police supposed to pay for Crimatrix?</h4>
                    <p>No. For the hotel guest list submission module of Crimatrix, hotels and lodges are to pay the subscription fees.</p>
                    <p>Police department is to pay for the modules designed for them. Eg. Vehicle Theft Reporting and Analysis module.</p>
                    <p>Crimatrix platform was conceptualized to have free and paid modules and services for police, enterprises as well as citizens. All modules will have a common goal - safer citizens and safer cities.</p>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                    <h4 class="SourceSansPro">4. On what basis the subscription fees for hotel was fixed at Rs 3000/yr?</h4>
                    <p>We have had several rounds of meetings with the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Assam and also individual guest house owners since Sept 2016 to discuss on the rate. Initially, we had proposed to have different pricing slabs based on number of rooms. But later we decided to go for a fixed minimal fees for all.</p>
                    <p>If you do the calculation, the monthly charge after govt. taxes come down to Rs.218/month or Rs.7.25/day , which we think, can be afforded by any business or an individual.</p>
                    <p>Also, without Crimatrix, complying with The Sarai’s Act 1867, would cost you more than double the subscription fees.</p>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                    <h4 class="SourceSansPro">5. How do we make the payment?</h4>
                    <p>As we support the Digital India mission and look forward to a cashless economy, we prefer online payment. We have partnered with one of the most popular and trusted payment gateway of India, Paytm for processing the subscription fees.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the online payment gateway, you may you may <em>“Request for Collection”</em>. Our representative will call you and visit your hotel to collect the payment within 48hrs.</p>

                    <h4 class="SourceSansPro">7. What is the duration of subscription?</h4>

                    <h4 class="SourceSansPro">8. We are a small guest house and cannot afford so much. Is there a discount for us? </h4>
                    <p>No. For ease of account management we cannot provide discount to individual	 hotels/lodges. Instead, we will give additional 3 months subscription free for guest houses or lodges with upto 5 rooms.</p>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">

                    <p>Your account will be suspended 15 days after the due date. You will be able to login and make the payment but will not be able to add any new guest record. Your subscription will be valid upto 30th June, 2018 irrespective of your date of payment.</p>
                    <p>During the time your account is suspended, you may revert back to physical submission of guest record at your respective police station.</p>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                    <h4 class="SourceSansPro">10. Will you increase the subscription fees next year or the year later?</h4>
                    <p>We don’t intend to. The Rs. 3000/yr subscription fees would be enough to sustain Crimatrix Hotel module. Instead, as more hotels join the platform, we’ll try to reduce the subscription fees per month through further optimisation of resources.

                    <h4 class="SourceSansPro">11. What’s the guarantee you won’t sell our guest data to 3rd party or other hotels?</h4>
                    <p>You own your data (Read our privacy policy). All guest records are stored in encrypted format in our database using the latest industry standards. So neither we nor any 3rd party can have access to your data. We also have a non disclosure agreement with police, where Glomindz is not authorized to use guest data for any other purpose.</p>
                    <p>It’s only when police searches for a particular name or mobile number, they get to see similar names or mobile numbers in our database.</p>

                    <h4 class="SourceSansPro">12. Why should we trust you?</h4>
                    <p>We have a big vision for Crimatrix. As technology evolves and we move towards a more tech enabled data driven smart cities, we want Crimatrix to become the de facto platform for crime prevention in real-time across Assam, if not India. You may consider it as community policing of the future. Vehicle theft reporting module was our first step and Hotel guestlist submission our second. But perhaps, there a hundred more steps for us to take before we achieve our vision. For more details, read our coverage by YourStory - India’s largest startup community.</p>
                    <p>We have also shared our vision for the platform at various national and state level tech events and startup competitions and have been recognised as one of the most innovative startups for Digital India.</p>
                    <p><em>We definitely wouldn’t want to spoil our reputation by opting to generate revenue through unethical means.</em></p>
